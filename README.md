# Technical Exercise (Publish/Subscribe pattern)

Weâ€™d like you to produce a small solution that demonstrates the concepts of the Publish/Subscribe pattern.



#### We want to get a better understanding of
- the code you produce
- how you go about architecting an extensible solution




#### Task
- Take an input of data
- Transform that data in some way
- Transport that data to a set of subscribers
- Have the subscribers display the transformed data

This should be created in pure C#. You are free to use third-party libraries to help with some aspects of it.

Solution should be testable, we are not looking for 100% code coverage but show examples of how you make  parts unit-testable.


#### Note:
Please don't make it more complex than necessary. We would like to see a piece of code as you would do on your normal working day.
